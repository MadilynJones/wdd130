    <p>I felt as though the instructions were incredibly
        vague as to what I was actually supposed to do.
        And I've actually used these things before, how is anyone
        new to this supposed to figure this out? Here's a puppy</p>

    <h2>AMERICA</h2>

    <p>America is fine. As long as you don't live in California or a
        major city like Chicago because that's way too expensive.</p>
    <h2>Indiana</h2>
    <img src="images/indiana.webp" alt="The Indiana Sign and Motto">
    <p>The crossroads of America. You only come here because it's in
        the way of where you really want to go. I think it's supposed
        to be taking about all the highways we have here, but it's not
        very exicting of a state regardless.</p>
